**karman** is a Python package for data driven thermospheric density estimation with Machine Learning. It offers support for inputs from several different sources (solar proxies, geomagnetic indices, OMNIWeb data, GOES EUV data, SOHO EUV data, POD-derived thermospheric density data and more). It contains models for both nowcasting and forecasting of thermospheric density, leveraging different ML models, including time fusion transformers.


The main developers are [Giacomo Acciarini](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/team/giacomo_acciarini/), [James Walsh](https://walsh.dev/).
