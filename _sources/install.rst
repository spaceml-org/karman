Installation from source
------------------------


Using ``git``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/spaceml-org/karman
   $ cd karman

And then either via `pip`:

.. code-block:: console
   
      $ pip install -e .

or via `conda` / `mamba`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mamba env create -f environment.yml
   $ mamba activate karman


We follow the usual PR-based development workflow, thus karman's ``main``
branch is normally kept in a working state.
