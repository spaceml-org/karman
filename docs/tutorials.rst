Data Inputs Download and Preprocessing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To download and pre-process the data, we provide a set of scripts, under `karman/scripts/input_data_prep`.

These are divided into three categories: data downloading, data pre-processing and data merging.

Note that these procedures can take quite some RAM & CPU time.

* Data downloading:
for this, you have to go in the `scripts/input_data_prep` and run the following commands (note, if you want to download the data for specific dates, or onto specific directories, you can pass the arguments, e.g. --output_dir path/to/dir, and similar, as preferred):
```bash
python download_tudelft_thermo.py
python download_sw_indices.py
python download_omniweb.py
python download_goes.py
python download_soho.py
```
We also run the NRLMSISE-00 model and collect the output for both the nowcasting and forecasting model (note that
if you want to change input/output path to directories, or configurations of the parallel processing, you can do so by specifying the arguments):
```bash
python run_nrlmsise00.py
python run_nrlmsise00_time_series.py
```
Once this is done, you can start the pre-processing.

* Data pre-processing:
for this, you have to go in the `scripts/input_data_prep` and run the following commands (note, if you want to pre-process the data onto specific directories, e.g. --output_dir path/to/dir 
you can do so by specifying the argument):
```bash
python process_tudelft_data.py
python process_sw_indices.py
python process_omniweb_data.py
python process_goes_data.py
python process_soho_data.py
```
Finally, you can merge the data.

```bash
python omni_data.py
python merge_sw_and_tudelft_data.py
```

* Data merging:
for this, you have to go in the `scripts/input_data_prep` and run the following commands (note, if you want to merge the data onto specific directories, e.g. --output_dir path/to/dir
you can do so by specifying the argument):

```bash
python merge_data.py
```
