Karman is a machine learning (ML) Python package for thermospheric density modelling. It was developed as a collaboration between the Heliophysics Division of NASA and [Trillium Technologies](https://trillium.tech/). 

Its main goal is to improve our understanding and modeling of thermospheric density variations due to the Sun's influence. Furthermore, it also has the objective to provide a shared framework where people can design, train and benchmark their own thermospheric density models.

## Goals

* Release of ML models to nowcast & forecast thermospheric density changes from solar and geomagnetic data, trained on precise orbit determination (POD)-derived thremospheric density measurements. 
* A framework to support ingestion of solar irradiance, geomagnetic and thermospheric density data from different sources. Currently, it supports data from: solar indexes (F10.7, M10.7, S10.7, Y10.7), geomagnetic indixes (Dst, Ap), SOHO EUV irradiance data, OMNIWeb high-resolution data, GOES EUV irradiance missions, POD-derived thermospheric density data.
* Framework to enable comparison between ML and empirical models at different geomagnetic storm conditions, altitude, times, etc.

## Supported Data

Currently, the Karman software supports several input data from different sources:
* High frequency (i.e., every 30 or 10 seconds) POD-derived thermospheric density data from five space missions (CHAMP, GOCE, GRACE, SWARM-A, SWARM-B), from [TU Delft thermosphere data](http://thermosphere.tudelft.nl/).
* NRLMSISE-00 thermospheric density empirical models inputs (and corresponding predicted density).
* Geomagnetic input data from [NASA's OMNIWeb high resolution data](https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/omni_min.html).
* Solar irradiance proxies commonly used in empirical thermospheric density models (i.e., F10.7, S10.7, M10.7, Y10.7).
* EUV Irradiance data from SOHO mission (from [LASP](https://lasp.colorado.edu/eve/data_access/eve_data/lasp_soho_sem_data/) website)
* EUV Irradiance data from GOES mission (from [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/goes-space-environment-monitor/access/science/euvs/) website)

We have dedicated tutorials and scripts to download and prepare each of these data sources for ML ingestion.
